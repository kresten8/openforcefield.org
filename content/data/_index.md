##### All our datasets are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/openforcefield) or on [QCArchive](http://qcarchive.molssi.org/). We are currently working on sharing our datasets used in force field optimization and benchmarking in a more systematic way. In the meantime, please refer to the links below or [contact us](mailto:info@openforcefield.org) if you have any questions!


## Quantum chemistry data

The Open Force Field Initiative uses [QCArchive infrastructure](http://qcarchive.molssi.org/) to compute, store and access quantum chemistry data. Our data generation and submission scripts, primarily contributed to by Jessica Maat and Hyesu Jang, are available [here](https://github.com/openforcefield/qca-dataset-submission).

## Physical properties

We are using [NIST ThermoML](https://www.nist.gov/mml/acmd/trc/thermoml) archive to access condensed phase physical properties of various compounds included in our force field optimization and benchmarking. Simon Boothroyd has developed a [tool](https://github.com/openforcefield/nistdataselection) for automated selection and curation of these datasets.

An older version of selected physical properties datasets can be found [here](https://github.com/openforcefield/open-forcefield-data).

## Protein-ligand free energies

Our protein-ligand benchmarking dataset, curated by David Hahn, for calculating binding free energies can be accessed [here](https://github.com/openforcefield/PLBenchmarks).

## MiniDrugBank

[This repository](https://github.com/openforcefield/MiniDrugBank) tracks the creation and evolution of the MiniDrugBank Molecule set, filtered from[DrugBank Release Version 5.0.1](https://www.drugbank.ca/releases/5-0-1).
