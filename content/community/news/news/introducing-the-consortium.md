We’re excited to announce the launch of the Open Force Field
Consortium, an academic-industry collaboration designed
to improve small molecule force fields used to guide pharmaceutical
drug discovery.  The Open Force Field Initiative is what we are calling
our overall research effort, whereas the Open Force Field Consortium 
refers specifically to the academic-industry collaboration.

Modeling tools based on force fields assist development of therapies
for diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disease throughout
academia and industry.  However, force field accuracy for small
molecule pharmaceuticals remains a major challenge due to the vast
space of molecular structure, bonding, and functionality. Thus, the
OpenFF Consortium focuses on improving small molecule force fields
using open software tools.

The Consortium stands out because of its open nature: All software,
force fields, and development tools are fully open source and broadly
available, as the participating organizations recognize that this
infrastructure can and should help the entire field.

The Consortium will develop an extensible, open source toolkit for
constructing, applying, and evaluating force fields; produce and
curate public datasets necessary to build high-accuracy biomolecular
force fields; and apply these tools and datasets to generate improved
force fields. Academic and industry partners work together to ensure
its success.

Consortium partners, both academic and commercial, bring a great deal
of expertise to the initiative. The Governing Board consists of five
initial PIs plus two elected industry representatives from the
Advisory Board. The five PIs are John Chodera (Sloan Kettering
Institute), Michael K. Gilson (University of California San Diego),
David Mobley (University of California, Irvine), Michael Shirts
(University of Colorado, Boulder), Lee-Ping Wang (University of
California, Davis). A group of commercial partners provide the primary
funding for the work, and OpenFF is also seeking potential additional
funding from foundations and federal agencies.

The Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) serves as a
coordinating intermediary, and helps to ensure developed software
follows best practices as well as encouraging synergy with other
open-source efforts within the molecular sciences.
 
“By building a community around an open, modern,
statistically-grounded toolkit for building and applying molecular
mechanics force fields from physical property and quantum chemical
datasets, we aim to democratize the construction of accurate force
fields, as well as provide tools to quantify the systematic error in
their predictions,” said John D. Chodera (MSKCC).

“Force fields represent the foundation of molecular simulations and
modeling -- a real community resource. Everyone uses them, but
improving them is an often unglamorous task. We’re very excited that
our industry partners recognize the importance of this problem and
have joined together to help support this important initiative, so
that we can improve modeling as a whole,” said David L. Mobley (UC
Irvine).
