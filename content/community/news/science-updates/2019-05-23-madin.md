## 

Today on the #propertycalculator call, we discussed working with NIST and their ThermoML property database to obtain a suitable dataset for parameterizing and benchmarking small molecules. 

* The Open Force Field Initiative is working with NIST in order to make a subset of ThermoML (and associated NIST uncertainties, which are essential for planned Bayesian analysis) publically available.  
* We defined preliminary SQL queries for the chemistries, conditions, and properties that OpenFF is interested in. 
* In the next few days, Simon Boothroyd and Owen Madin will look through a preliminary copy of this database and analyze which chemistries and properties will be useful.
* Michael Shirts and Simon Boothroyd will head up communication with NIST personnel.
