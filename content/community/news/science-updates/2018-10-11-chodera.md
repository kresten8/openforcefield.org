We're excited to introduce Open Force Field Science Updates, a lightweight science blog series in which researchers working with the [Open Force Field Initiative](http://openforcefield.org) will post about their research and engineering directions and scientific progress on various aspects of the Initiative.
To start with, researchers will post roughly once every two weeks around the time of subgroup project meetings, with posts tagged by the subgroup activity.
These posts will often include figures, like these from our [ThermoML Archive benchmark paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jced.7b00104):

![GAFF densities](gaff-densities.jpg "GAFF densities")
![GAFF dielectrics](gaff-dielectrics.jpg "GAFF dielectrics")

Stay tuned for updates from the physical property calculation subgroup!
