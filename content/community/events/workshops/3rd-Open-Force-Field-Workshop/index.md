title: 3rd Open Force Field Workshop
description: The Third Open Force Field Workshop was initially as an in-person gathering in Boston on May 4-5, 2020, but this meeting was cancelled due to the Covid-19 outbreak. This in-person meeting was replaced by a virtual meeting on the same dates. We decided to slightly experiment with the workshop format by making most of the content available before the meeting for asynchronous consumption.

##### May 4-5, 2020  |  Virtual meeting

Namely, all talks will be pre-recorded and the meeting time will be focused on discussions around those talks and future planning. The only live presentation will be a keynote on Day 2 by[David Cerutti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-cerutti-11321129), who has recently joined the Open Force Field Initiative as a senior scientist and who will lead the NIH-funded efforts in the biopolymer arena. The main aim of this format is to make this virtual meeting more interactive, and hopefully, more productive.
