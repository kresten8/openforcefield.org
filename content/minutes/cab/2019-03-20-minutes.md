The [Open Force Field Consortium Advisory Board](https://openforcefield.org/consortium/) met on 20 March, 2019.
The minutes are summarized as follows:

### Open Forcefield Advisory Board Meeting Minutes – March 20, 2019

* Status Updates:
  * OFFI NIH proposal submitted and [available publicly](https://openforcefield.org/news/seeking-nih-funding/)
  * Hiring update:
    * [Karmen Condic-Jurkic](http://www.choderalab.org/members/#karmen-condic-jurkic) starts April 1 as half-time scientific coordinator/project manager
    * Interviews ongoing for bespoke torsion fitting and potentially electrostatics role
  * [Open Force Field Toolkit](http://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield) update:
    * Alpha release slated for April 2
    * Will contain [RDKit](http://www.rdkit.org/) backend support in abstracted cheminformatics structure (allowing future support for alternative cheminformatics packages to be easily added)
      * Supposed to give same results regardless of RDKit or OpenEye (tested with ~2k molecules from eMolecules to have same energies, forces, and force terms)
        * Differences in aromaticity models could result in some differences in corner cases
        * We are adding a “paranoid mode” so we can detect differences between toolkits that arise when building force fields
      * [SDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_table_file#SDF) with standardized tags will be the supported method for importing molecules with custom charges
        * OpenEye and RDKit on-board with standardized tags for charges
    * There may have been minor changes to XML forcefield format since the January preview release
      * Changes are summarized [here](https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield/issues/191)
    * OFFI hope is to have weekly/biweekly bugfix or feature releases and conda package updates
    * Partners and users are directed to use the [Github issue tracker](ttps://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield/issues/) to report issues or problems
  * Technical questions – Desmond support
    * How is Desmond currently used by Partners?  What kind of Desmond support is needed?
      * Need for [FEP+](https://www.schrodinger.com/fep) compatibility will likely have to involve discussions with Schrodinger
      * Industry would ideally like to compare forcefields (including OPLS3/3e) and FEP protocols ([FEP+](https://www.schrodinger.com/fep), [YANK](http://getyank.org), etc.)
      * Kaushik to work with PIs to provide some examples for testing
    * Desmond’s [`msys`](https://github.com/DEShawResearch/msys) release allows dms files to be written directly, so could be used to construct system with SMIRNOFF parameters
      * Advantage of being independent of Maestro/Schrodinger
    * Reports on usage by partners since January meeting:
      * Limited use so far - many people awaiting RDKit release to begin internal use
      * Training:
        * Plan for YouTube video for basics, followed by webex
        * Mobley to check with Jeff Wagner on training plan
        * Request for tutorial on using SMIRNOFF w/ [YANK](http://getyank.org)
          * Chodera to organize, probably need at least 1 month after April release to integrate SMIRNOFF support into YANK
    * Other stuff
      * Poster at [ALCHEMICAL FREE ENERGY WORKSHOP 2019 in Göttingen](http://pmx.mpibpc.mpg.de/workshop_alchemistry2019/index.html).  Thoughts are to highlight OFF Consortium from industry (user) perspective (D. Kuhn, Katharina)
        * Daniel and Ross to connect to work on this to coordinate with GRC poster to ensure complimentarity and common usage of some materials.  Mobley to help by providing figures, etc.
      * GRC informal session/get-together
        * People still waiting to see who will be attending
        * 1:1 time with Jeff Wagner might be better use of time at the GRC than an organized session
      * Next Open Force Field Consortium face-to-face meeting scheduled for August 30-31, 2019 (Friday and Saturday) in San Diego
    * Group for evaluating protein-ligand binding free energies being assembled by John Chodera ( see Slack ) to curate additional benchmark sets
