The minutes are summarized as follows:

### Open Forcefield Advisory Board Meeting Minutes – 17 April 2019


* K. Condic-Jurkic to take over future agenda planning with input from D. Kuhn, I. Craig, A. Narayanan
* Release update by Jeff Wagner:
  * 0.2.1 bugfix release on the 12th after initial 0.2.0 release on 8th  
      * Version numbers indicate API is still in flux, there may be function call changes, etc. in later versions, e.g., 0.3, 0.4, ...
      * Aiming to have more established base by version 1.0.0
  * Highlighted features of new release:
      * Independent of OpenEye by providing RDKit Cheminformatics support
      * The biggest issues appeared in aromaticity perception, but this has been addressed
      * Likely difference in partial charge assignment due to different methods for producing AM1-BCC charges (OpenEye vs. [AmberTools](http://ambermd.org/AmberTools.php) for RDKit)
      * No differences in available functionality
      * Changes to internal data structures to facilitate FF improvement
      * `ForceField` class is an example, allowing parameter changes with python before assignment
  * Short-term goals
      * Tarball build for non-Conda installation
      * Reading charges from SDF using standardized charge fields
      * Support for library charges for automated assignment
      * Fractional bond order interpolation
      * GBSA parameter assignment
      * Better file format conversion support
  * Toolkit development progress can be tracked on github
      * https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield/milestones
  * Video tutorial
      * Available at https://youtu.be/oC8LXc0dhoE
      * Please watch before 1:1 to facilitate 1:1 chats (to be setup)
  * **Initially minor releases may come out weekly** (e.g. 0.2.2, 0.2.3) while more significant changes may come out monthly (e.g. 0.3, 0.4)
  * Best places to go with problems (in no particular order):
      * Slack `#tech-support` or `#documentation` channels
      * Github issue tracker: http://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield/issues
  * Support for both RDKit and OE toolkits for now, long-term support will depend on the amount of resources available to maintain it
* Applications/workflows
  * Examples of using SMIRNOFF in different ways would be helpful
  * Robustly developed workflows may be out of scope right now and the primary focus of OpenFF is force field development - making it easy for others to build their own apps using OpenFF resources
  * Example usage can be provided; requests in #documentation channel
* Hiring Update
  * Still trying to fill position for bespoke torsion fitting
  * Contract extension for Y. Qiu (Wang) and D. Slochower (Gilson) to work on ForceBalance parameter fitting and binding energy benchmarks, respectively
* Next meeting
  * Scientific updates highlighting scientific progress on the following topics:
  * Where we were when we met in January;
  * What progress has been made;
  * What is happening next?
  * Update on finances
* Other stuff:
  * OpenFF Seminar Series – contact David with ideas for speakers and topics of interest
  * Contact David/Karmen if you know of any additional interested pharma partners
  * Adding people on Slack
  * Karmen to try to provide digestible summaries of scientific progress in subgroups
