The [Open Force Field Initiative](http://openforcefield.org/) is seeking a talented postdoctoral fellow to work on the development of modern toolkits and new methods for building next-generation molecular mechanics force fields. In particular, we are seeking for someone who:

- understands quantum chemistry methods and physical organic chemistry,
- can help us make decisions about how we generate the training sets for our force fields, and
- is passionate about open source software and open science.

The candidate is expected to lead our efforts around generation, curation and management of quantum chemistry datasets. Our QC data is publicly accessible on the [MolSSI QCArchive](https://qcarchive.molssi.org/), but we would like to make this data more accessible and easier to (re)use, and achieving this goal would be one of the duties associated with this role. We also expect the candidate to assist with force field optimization processes and benchmarking studies, perform scientific studies to inform future decisions in force field development, and of course, work together with the entire team to iteratively improve our force fields and infrastructure. As mentioned above, the candidate will also frequently interact with MolSSI scientists supporting QCArchive. [QCArchive](https://qcarchive.molssi.org/) enables computing and storing of quantum chemistry data and it is powered by modular and open source infrastructure. Depending on the candidate&#39;s interests, the position could also potentially include contributions to QCArchive infrastructure development and maintenance. The candidate will have a reasonable amount of independence in their work, especially in their core area of expertise, although a certain level of coordination is required in this collaborative project.

 Many aspects of this position can be tailored around the candidate&#39;s expertise and ambitions and we would encourage everyone excited about application of quantum chemistry, force field development and open science to apply!

## About us: ##
We are a [distributed team](https://openforcefield.org/members/) of PhD students, postdocs and software scientists led by 5 academic PIs â€“ Mike Gilson, David Mobley, Lee-Ping Wang, Michael Shirts, and John Chodera. The effort has been primarily funded by the Open Force Field Consortium and since March 2020, the Initiative has been awarded a 5-year NIH grant focused on development of accurate biomolecular force fields. The [Open Force Field Consortium](https://openforcefield.org/consortium/) is an [alliance of pharmaceutical and biotech companies](https://openforcefield.org/news/introducing-the-consortium/) aiming to advance the state of force fields for biomolecular simulation and design through an open collaborative effort. In our organization, the postdocs and PhD students do research and exploratory work using our tools/data, while a team of software scientists (holding PhDs in biomolecular research) support these researchers by doing long-term project planning and developing [our software ecosystem](https://openforcefield.org/consortium/software/). More about our scientific goals and plans can be found in the Open Force Field Initiative [Executive Summary](https://openforcefield.org/science/downloads/roadmap/open-forcefield-summary.pdf).

 The Open Force Field Initiative is built on principles of open source, open data, and open science. We aim to publish frequently and openly and a sample of existing publications can be found [here](http://openforcefield.org/publications). All of our software is released under permissive licenses and we try to share all data produced in our efforts. We also release frequent scientific updates on our website and on GitHub, and we have yearly meetings with our pharma partners to give updates on our progress. In addition to this and other events, the OpenFF Initiative provides access to a large network of young and established scientists in computational chemistry from academia and industry, offering access to both academic and industry career paths. Supporting all team members in achieving their career goals is taken seriously by all OpenFF PIs.

## Location ##

The preferred physical location for this position would be the [Mobley lab](([http://mobleylab.org](http://mobleylab.org/)) as UC Irvine, CA. However, we can offer a certain amount of flexibility around location and the Open Force Field postdocs can be hosted at any of the participating investigator sites:

- [Michael K. Gilson](http://gilson.cloud.ucsd.edu/) (UCSD, La Jolla, CA)
- [John D. Chodera](http://choderalab.org/) (MSKCC, New York City, NY)
- [Lee-Ping Wang](https://chemistry.ucdavis.edu/people/lee-ping-wang) (UCD, Davis, CA)
- [David L. Mobley](http://mobleylab.org/) (UCI, Irvine, CA)
- [Michael R. Shirts](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/shirtsgroup/) (University of Colorado, Boulder, CO)

Due to the relocation and traveling complications arising from the Covid-19 outbreak, the OpenFF Initiative would consider remote work options for suitable candidates.
