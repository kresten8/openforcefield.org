The **Open Force Field Initiative** is seeking talented postdoctoral fellows to work on the development of modern toolkits and new methods for building next-generation molecular mechanics force fields.
The effort has been primarily funded by the [Open Force Field Consortium](https://openforcefield.org/consortium/) - an [alliance of pharmaceutical and biotech companies](https://openforcefield.org/news/introducing-the-consortium/) aiming to advance the state of force fields for biomolecular simulation and design through an open collaborative effort.
Postdocs will work closely with other researchers in the Initiative, multiple academic Initiative PIs, industry Partner scientific collaborators, and software scientists in the at [MolSSI](http://molssi.org) to develop and apply new algorithms and modern open source software infrastructure for building high quality biomolecular force fields.
We aim to publish frequently and openly and a sample of existing publications can be found [here](http://openforcefield.org/publications).
The [Open Force Field Initiative](http://openforcefield.org) is a multi-investigator collaboration that aims to build new, quantitatively accurate molecular mechanics force fields supported by a modern software infrastructure, built on principles of open source, open data, and open science. More about their scientific goals and plans can be found in the Open Force Field Initiative [Executive Summary](https://openforcefield.org/science/downloads/roadmap/open-forcefield-summary.pdf).
