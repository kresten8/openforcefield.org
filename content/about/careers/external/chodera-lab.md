## 1. Bayer sponsored postdoctoral fellows (New York / Berlin) ##

The [Chodera lab](http://www.choderalab.org/) in New York and the [Volkamer group](https://physiologie-ccm.charite.de/en/research_at_the_institute/team_volkamer/) in Berlin are seeking talented postdoctoral fellows to work at the interface of structure-informed machine learning and alchemical free energy calculations as part of an exciting new collaboration between these two labs. This project seeks to develop an integrated framework for utilizing both state-of-the-art machine learning approaches and free energy calculations to exploit structural data, assay data, and scalable computing resources to predict the impact of point mutations on the binding of small molecule kinase inhibitors, with a goal toward expanding the utility of clinical kinase inhibitors.

The positions are part of a collaboration with Bayer AG, Germany, pending final confirmation of funding in duration of 2 years. We are seeking candidates to start as soon as possible at our locations in New York and Berlin.
